# UI-UX-Experiment1

Aim:

To understand the fundamentals of UI and UX, differentiate between them using real-world examples, study their relationship in design, and explore various UI/UX design tools.

Algorithm:

Step 1: Study the basic concepts of User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX).

Step 2: Identify the key components of UI such as colors, typography, buttons, layout, and icons.

Step 3: Identify UX elements like user research, wireframing, usability testing, and user journey mapping.

Step 4: Analyze a real-world application (e.g., food delivery app) to differentiate UI and UX.

Step 5: Observe how UI and UX work together to improve user satisfaction.

Step 6: Explore popular UI/UX tools such as Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, InVision, and Balsamiq.

Step 7: Create a simple wireframe or interface using a UI/UX design tool.

Step 8: Evaluate how the design improves user interaction and experience.
